# SeaSketch Reporting Template


SeaSketch reports are built upon two major components. The first are geoprocessing services built currently 
on arcgis server. These services accept a "Sketch" or "SketchCollection" and output the results of spatial
analysis on those feature(s). The second component is that used to visualize the output of these services.
These "Client Reporting Modules" can depend on the output of zero, one, or many geoprocessing services and
present user-friendly representations of the output. This repository is a template from which all client 
reporting modules shoudl be based on.

## Steps to creating and deploying a Report

  1. Fork the seasketch-report-template repository
  2. Install the source code for this fork locally
  3. Use grunt to host the reporting module locally 
  4. Configure the SketchClass of interest to load your locally hosted fork
  5. Modify the reporting code to meet the project's needs
  6. Ask a SeaSketch team member to fork your repository within the mcclintock-lab organization
  7. Update the SketchClass settings within the admin interface to point at the report code hosted on mcclintock-lab.github.io
  8. As updates to the reporting modules are needed, send pull requests to the fork hosted on mcclintock-lab
